## Further information

If you have any questions regarding your submission, please contact the task organizers (`habernal@ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de`).

For some team names, we used the CodaLab login. There are two reasons for that:

* Some participants provided very long system name which does not fit the table
* Some participants have not yet replied to our inquiry about system name and details.

If you want to change your name, feel free to contact us.
